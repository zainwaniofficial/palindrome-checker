# Palindrome Checker

## About
This project, created by **Tawseef Maqbool**, is a web-based Palindrome Checker. It allows users to input a string and checks whether it is a palindrome (a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward). The project is designed to help beginners practice JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## Features
- Checks if the input string is a palindrome.  
- Ignores case sensitivity and non-alphanumeric characters.  
- Responsive and user-friendly interface.

## Technologies Used
- HTML  
- CSS  
- JavaScript

## How to Use
1. Clone or download the repository.  
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.  
3. Enter a string in the input field and click the "Check" button.  
4. The result will indicate whether the string is a palindrome.

## Customization
You can modify the logic in the `script.js` file to adjust how the palindrome check works (e.g., including/excluding spaces, symbols, etc.).
